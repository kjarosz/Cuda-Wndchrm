=== 1. LICENSE ===

This software is covered under the terms of the MIT license. Please see
LICENSE.txt for more information.


=== 2. ABOUT THE ALGORITHMS ===

The algorithms in this project are CUDA-enabled versions of those from the
original UDAT image analysis software supplied to us by Dr. Lior Shamir at
Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, MI. Many of these algorithms
are described in a paper on the Wndchrm software here:
http://scfbm.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0473-3-13

So far, the project contains code for the following algorithms modified to use
CUDA:

  - Zernicke
  - Haralick
  - Multi-scale histograms

Some of the other algorithms which still need to be converted include:

  - Gabor texture features
  - Tamura texture features


=== 3. COMPILATION ===

CUDA UDAT is currently hosted on GitHub in source form here:
https://github.com/kjarosz/new_cuda_udat

If you are using Git with a command line interface or terminal, you can simply
run the following command to get the latest version of the main code branch:

git clone https://github.com/kjarosz/new_cuda_udat.git


=== 4. COMPILATION ===

--- 4.1 PREREQUISITES ---

After you have obtained the CUDA UDAT source code, you will need to make sure
you also have the following installed:

  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2013*
  - NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit
    - This is currently available at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit

* Note: The version of Visual Studio you use is important, since NVIDIA
currently does not support any newer versions like 2015 with their CUDA
Toolkit yet.

You will need to be using a Windows PC with an NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA
technology. We have not tried compiling or running our code on any other
operating system or IDE, and currently have no plans to do so nor support such
alternative setups.

--- 4.2 COMPILING THE CODE ---
The Visual Studio project is already prepared and ready to compile. Simply go
into the Build menu and hit Build Solution, and the code will be compiled.


=== 5. USING THE CODE ===

The application accepts only one argument and it is the directory containing
the classes of images. The folder structure expected consists of a root
directory and multiple folders for each class of images. The images will have
to be placed into the class directories, otherwise they will not be read. The
output of the application will be saved in the root directory.


=== 6. FEEDBACK ===

Bugs, questions, and other feedback may be submitted to the authors of this
software here:
