# CUDA UDAT
A collection of algorithms design to process images into ones more usable in other algorithms.

These algorithms are being optimized for use with NVIDIA [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) GPU
technology, so that multiple images can be processed in parallel for higher throughput.

This is a research project performed under the direction of
[Dr. Lior Shamir](http://www.ltu.edu/arts_sciences/mathematics_computer_science/l_shamir.asp) at Lawrence Technological
University.
